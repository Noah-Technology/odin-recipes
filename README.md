# odin-recipes
This is my first project.
I am learning how to set up basic HTML with a basic recipes website.
I am making new recipes for the website, which will be accessed via the
home page. Each recipe will have an image, a description, an
ingredients list, and a steps list. I chose macaroni for my first one
because it's one of my favorites. I also chose pizza for the same
reason. I only chose a sandwich because it seemed easy to make a recipe
for.

Please Note: I am new to git, so my commit messages are not amazing.
(I also made many mistakes within them)
